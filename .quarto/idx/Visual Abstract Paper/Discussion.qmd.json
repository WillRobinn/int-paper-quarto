Pairwise analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in resting SBP and DBP following all exercise modes except AIT. All modes demonstrated substantially larger reductions in hypertensive cohorts than those with normal baseline blood pressure. As shown by the primary NMA, the rank order of effectiveness based on SUCRA values for SBP were IET ranked highest followed by CT, RT, AET and HIIT. IET was also highest ranked in the DBP NMA, followed by RT, HIIT, CT and AET. NMA of the secondary exercise submodes for SBP found IWS to be the most effective, followed by ILE, IHG, cycling, running, CT, SIT, other aerobic, RT, AIT and finally, walking. The DBP secondary NMA found running to be the most effective submode, followed by IWS, IHG, ILE, cycling, SIT, RT, AIT, other aerobic, CT and walking.\n\n![Central illustration. AET, aerobic exercise training; CT, combined training; HIIT, high-intensity interval training; IET, isometric exercise training; RT, dynamic resistance training.](Figures\\figure6.jpg){#fig-6}\n\n{{< downloadthis Figures\\Figure6.jpg label = \"Download Figure as Image\" >}}\n{{< downloadthis Figures\\Figure6.ppt label = \"Download Figure in Powerpoint\" >}}\n\nTo our knowledge, only two previous large-scale meta-analyses of similar proportion have been performed.^[@ref21,@ref22]^ However, the present study is the first to incorporate HIIT as a novel exercise mode, as well as provide advanced submode analyses of walking, cycling, running, SIT, AIT, IHG, ILE and IWS for the purpose of exercise prescription optimisation. Cornelissen *et al*^[@ref21]^ similarly reported IET to be the most effective exercise mode, but largely differed in magnitude for all other mode analyses, which is probably attributable to the substantial number of newer trials included in the present analysis. This is supported by the more recent Naci *et al*^[@ref22]^ NMA, which did not assess DBP, but showed more homogeneous AET, RT and CT SBP changes than in the present work. Given the emphasis placed on the Cornelissen and Smart21 study in both the ESC/ESH5 and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)4 blood pressure management guidelines, the findings of the present study, combined with that of Naci *et al,*^[@ref22]^ suggest the need for an exercise recommendation guideline update.\n\nA previous meta-review from Hanssen *et al*^[@ref44]^ sought to identify optimal personalised exercise prescription practices in the prevention and treatment of hypertension by indirectly comparing meta-analysis data from varying exercise modes. Differentially, our work applied a more direct approach in statistically comparing all individual RCTs. As such, our differences in findings, particularly for IET, may be in part attributed to the inevitable reliance of Hanssen *et al*^[@ref44]^ on older meta-analysis data to summarise the current effectiveness of IET,^[@ref45,@ref46,@ref47]^ as well as the inherent limitations of indirect meta-analytic comparisons. In particular, this previous umbrella review showed the inequitable over-representation of AET and RT meta-analysis research, concurrent with the under-representation of IET, CT and HIIT meta-analysis work, resulting in dependence on inadequately powered and dated systematic review and meta-analysis data to draw comparative conclusions.^[@ref44]^ As our analysis sourced the data directly from each RCT, this limiting gap between the dissemination of RCT data and its eventual transfer into published meta-analysis research was not present in our work.\n\nImportantly, this updated analysis now provides large-scale data establishing CT as an effective exercise mode in reducing blood pressure, a mode which was previously considered inconclusive due to insufficient evidence.^[@ref21]^ Naci *et al*^[@ref22]^ previously reported similar SBP changes, but without any DBP data to support, while Hanssen *et al*^[@ref44]^ also provided support for CT but could only make limited comparative inferences on the basis of a single meta-analysis.^[@ref48]^ While the reductions observed from CT ostensibly appear somewhat comparable to those of IET, our novel analysis demonstrates that this magnitude of SBP reduction following CT is predominantly moderated by the greater prevalence of hypertensive populations included within the analysis. Indeed, the magnitude of change is underwhelming in those studies of normal blood pressure and prehypertensive cohorts, and the NMA SBP sensitivity analysis revealed the fragile nature of this body of data. Separately, and conversely to previous reports,^[@ref21]^ RT now appears comparable to AET in reducing resting blood pressure. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of AET seems dependent on the submode performed, with cycling and running significantly more effective than walking AET. Our meta-regression analyses also reported the tendency for a greater SBP reduction with lower weekly training frequency in AET. Considering the interstudy differences in research protocols, the reason for this finding is unclear, but may provide loose support for the application of AET at a lower (eg, 3 times per week) frequency as opposed to extensive weekly volumes (≥5 times per week).\n\nAs a novel intervention, HIIT produced clinically relevant reductions in both SBP and DBP but ranked as the least effective among all primary modes for SBP. Secondary submode analyses (both pairwise and NMA) reveal the overarching SBP reductions to be primarily driven by SIT (low volume, maximal intensity intervals), while AIT (4×4 min intervals) failed to reach statistical significance for either SBP or DBP. This finding, combined with the comparative inferiority of walking against running and cycling AET, appears to highlight the need for higher intensity training to produce the greatest blood pressure reductions.\n\nSimilarly to IET, HIIT has recently generated substantial research interest due to its time-efficient and convenient nature, suggesting, although not without some disagreement,^[@ref49]^ the potential for increased adoption and adherence, with both modes having promising future clinical utility.^[@ref50,@ref51,@ref52,@ref53,@ref54]^ However, the outcomes of this analysis support our previous work,^[@ref24]^ which concluded that IET was the superior antihypertensive exercise mode. While IET may still require larger-scale longitudinal RCTs,^[@ref51,@ref55]^ its clinical implementation as the primary recommended exercise mode in managing blood pressure in normotensive, prehypertensive and hypertensive individuals is supported by the present results. Importantly, the previous work of Cornelissen and Smart^[@ref21]^ included only four IET trials in 2013. Since then, a number of IET trials and subsequent meta-analyses over the previous decade have been published,^[@ref24,@ref45,@ref56,@ref57,@ref58]^ with the present study including 19 RCTs. Subsequently, the confidence interval of this finding has substantially narrowed,^[@ref59]^ providing more accurate SBP and DBP effect sizes of 8.2 and 4.0mm Hg, respectively, which is comparable to standard-dose antihypertensive monotherapy.^[@ref60,@ref61]^\n\nOf interest, the NMA findings highlight the IWS as more effective than the traditionally employed IHG. Despite the support of this analysis for IET, a degree of caution when interpreting these findings is advised given the current disparity in the quantity of trials analysed.^[@ref56]^ As seen in figure 5, the NMA included no direct comparative IET data. Previous trials that did not meet the inclusion criteria of this analysis have indeed shown conflicting results regarding the comparative effectiveness of IET against current exercise guidelines,^[@ref62,@ref63]^ which requires consideration when interpreting these findings.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n<font size=\"4\"><strong>Limitations</strong></font>\n</summary>\n\n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Although only RCTs were included in this analysis, our TESTEX risk of bias assessment demonstrated several limitations consistent across the exercise training literature, including poor control group activity monitoring, missing intention-to-treat analyses and participant and investigator awareness on group allocation. Furthermore, with such a large analysis, we inevitably included trials of varying participant populations, statistical and methodological processes and exercise intervention specifics. As a likely consequence of this interstudy variability, we found significant heterogeneity for the majority of analyses. Additionally, we also found significant publication bias for overall AET SBP and DBP and IET DBP. Some of the more novel exercise modes, such as SIT, AIT, ILE and IWS involved an analysis of comparatively fewer RCTs than that of the more established modes such as AET and RT. As a result, these submodes could not be stratified and analysed by baseline blood pressure status. Finally, the majority of RCTs included in this analysis set a priori minimum attendance thresholds for inclusion in their analysis (eg, >80% of sessions completed). Therefore, our training compliance moderator analysis is, by default, not inclusive of low attendance rates, and these findings should be interpreted only in the context of assessing a compliance moderator effect among those individuals who are already adhering.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n<font size=\"4\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font>\n</summary>\n\n\nAerobic exercise training, dynamic resistance training, combined training, high-intensity interval training and isometric exercise training are all significantly effective in reducing resting SBP and DBP.
